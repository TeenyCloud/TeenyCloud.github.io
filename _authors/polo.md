bio: "My journey in computing started with an Apple II playing Lode Runner, then moved to a Macintosh LC at age 10 in the early 90s. While most people navigated command-line interfaces, I was exploring graphical user interfaces on the Mac. Ironically, I later experienced the inverse evolution—discovering Linux at 17, properly learning Unix at 20, and becoming hooked on the command line. While others embraced Windows GUI, I spent most of my time in terminals. I discovered the Internet in 1994 when it wasn't yet widespread. I studied Computer Science with a focus on Distributed Systems, and now work as a software engineering manager."
